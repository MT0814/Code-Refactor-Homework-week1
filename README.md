# Homework for week1 

***Version 1.0.1 Date 08/07/21***

In this project, I modified some HTML tags, gave it a concise, descriptive title, added alt for img tags and add an id to make the Search Engine Optimization link work. Combined some Class to make CSS look clean and neat.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Other enhancements for the look and feel (UX)

* Adjusted the length of `benefits` part to make it looks the same length as `content` part.

```
.benefit {
    height: 75em;
}
```
* Adjusted the margin for `content` and `benefit` to center both in webpage for a better look.
```
  .Content {
  margin-left: 1.9em;
  }

  .benefit {
    margin-right: 1.9em;
  }
```
